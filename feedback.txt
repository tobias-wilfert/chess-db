Interesting and original project proposal.
The main challenge will likely be finding a good distance measure and how to adapt the indexing 
structure for the distance measure. Evaluating through chess puzzles is an interesting idea. 
One caveat: make sure the IR content of the project is sufficientyl covered;
try for instance different document similarity measures.
