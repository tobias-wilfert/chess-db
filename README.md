# Chess-DB: An Information Retrieval System for Chess Positions

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the project for the course Information Retrieval. For more information about the project see the [project proposal](./project_proposal.pdf)

## Overview
This repository contains the following items:
 - [src/](./src) - The bulk of the source code, this includes the scrips that were used to generate the datasets as well as the jupyter notebooks that were used through out the project.
 - [results/](./results) - Excerpts of the result we got from the notebooks. For the full context as to what the files contain please refer to the notebooks in particular the [evaluation notebook](./src/6-evaluation.ipynb).
 - [demo/](./demo/) - A demo of the project in the from of a web application. This application allows users to specify a given chess position and then find similar ones in the dataset. 
 - [project_proposal.pdf](./project_proposal.pdf) - The project proposal
 - [README.md](./README.md) - This file
 - [LICENSE](./LICENSE) - The license for this project

**Note:** This repository does not contain the datasets that were used for this project. This is due to the size constraints of GitHub. However all the code that is needed to generate the datasets can be found in this repository should there be interest in the dataset feel free to open an issue and we will find a way to share the dataset.
